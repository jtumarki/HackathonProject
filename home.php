  <h1>Welcome to SisterMatch!</h1>
  <p>Getting to know all of your sorority sisters can be hard, especially since all of them come from such a variety of different majors and backgrounds. SisterMatch is designed to help sorority women, especially new members, connect with each other by matching them up based on personality traits, interests, and Facebook likes (future feature!). It encourages the matched pairs to go out on sister dates together and record memories of their outings afterwards. Make lasting friendships and strengthen your sisterhood with SisterMatch!</p>
